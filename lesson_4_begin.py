# --- THE PRICE HERO CALCULATOR ---
# This script builds a reusable tool to calculate final shopping prices.

# 1. THE TOOL (Defining the Function)


# 2. USING THE TOOL (The 'I Do')


# We can use our tool over and over with different numbers!


# 3. GLOBAL LOGIC


# --- THE CHALLENGE (YOU DO) ---
# 1. Update the function definition to include a third parameter: 'tax'.
# 2. Inside the function, add the tax to the 'final_price' before returning it.
#    (Hint: final_price = final_price + tax)
# 3. Call the function again with a tax of 5.00 and see the result.
