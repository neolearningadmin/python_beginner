# --- THE BULK TASK LABELER ---
# This script automates the formatting of a daily work schedule.

# 1. THE DATA (The List)


# 2. THE PROCESSING (The Loop)


# We use 'enumerate' to get both the index (number) and the task name


# 3. THE SUMMARY


# --- THE CHALLENGE (YOU DO) ---
# 1. Add a new task called "Workout" to the list.
# 2. Add an 'if' statement inside the loop:
#    If the 'item' is "Lunch", print "--- BREAK TIME ---" instead of the task.
