# --- THE SMART GATEKEEPER ---
# This script decides if a user is allowed into a restricted area.

# 1. THE DATA (The Setup)


# 2. THE INPUTS


# 3. THE LOGIC (The Fork in the Road)
# We check age first, then the password.


# --- THE CHALLENGE (YOU DO) ---
# 1. Add a new 'elif' for a "Banned User."
# 2. If the user's name is "Bob", print "ACCESS DENIED: Bob is banned from this club!"
# (Hint: You'll need to add a name input at the top first!)
